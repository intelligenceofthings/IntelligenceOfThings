# üß† Intelligence of Things (IoT) ‚Äì Research and Development

Welcome to the official GitHub profile for **Intelligence of Things (IoT)** ‚Äì an open research initiative exploring the intersection of **AI**, **embedded systems**, and **context-aware smart environments**.

This repository suite is designed to support and showcase ongoing scientific work in **perceptual computing**, **human-in-the-loop systems**, and **autonomous smart home agents**. It includes complete, open-source components ranging from **zero-shot vision-based detection** to **intelligent device actuation**, all tailored for real-world applications.

## üåê About the Project

**Intelligence of Things** is an umbrella for multiple interlinked research efforts focused on:

- Spatially-aware smart home agents
- Multimodal human-environment interaction
- Zero-shot object and intent recognition
- Integration with commercial device ecosystems (e.g., Tuya, Google Home)
- Cognitive workload reduction in assistive systems
- Regional language and accessibility-aware interfaces

Our research aims to make ambient intelligence **practical, modular, and human-centric**.
